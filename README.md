# Show Grade (showgrade)
Moodle block that shows total points and level for a grade category with natural aggregation.

Introduction
------------
The Moodle grading system can be a great gamification platform. This plugin exploits the natural type aggregation of grade categories, where activities have their points added up, so it can work as a point system.

Usage
-----
Add the block as a teacher and configure the block.
Change the block title an choose one or more grade categories. If you can't see any you must add or change grade categories with natural type aggregation.

You can choose to show the maximum points, the completion percentage and levels. Levels are linear and you need to configure the points needed to level up.

After that a student will see a block with points achieved for the category (or categories) and optionally maximum ponts, percentage and level.

If you want to award badges when achieving certaing levels you can install the companion plugin [badgelevel](https://github.com/Canx/moodle-local_badgelevel)
